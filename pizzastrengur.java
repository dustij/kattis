/**
 * Today is game day at Tommi's Pizzas, so Georg and his friends are going to order some pizzas.
 * The game starts with the employees at Tommi's Pizzas choosing a secret passcode, consisting only of the letters {"P", "I", "Z", "A"},
 * and telling the customer the length of the passcode. If Georg and his friends manage to guess the passcode in at most m attempts,
 * they get their pizza for free!
 * 
 * Georg and his friends may pick words shorter than the passcode as guesses, in which case they will be told whether the guess is a prefix of the passcode.
 * The goal is to help Georg and his friends in guessing the passcode, so they can get their pizza for free.
 * 
 * A word A is considered a prefix of a word B if B starts with A. For example, "PIZ" is a prefix of "PIZZA", but "ZZA" is not a prefix of "PIZZA".
 * 
 * <h2>Interactivity</h2>
 * This is an interactive problem. Your solution will be tested against an interactive judge which reads the output of your solution
 * and prints the input your solution receives. The interaction follows these rules:
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The judge starts by printing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^4), which represents the length of the passcode S. The passcode only contains the letters {"P", "I", "Z", "A"}.</li>
 *   <li>Next, your solution must output a guess string P which must contain at least 1 letter and at most n letters.</li>
 *   <li>After this, the judge will respond as follows:</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>If P is not a prefix of S, the judge will print 0.</li>
 *     <li>If P is a prefix of S, the judge will print 1.</li>
 *     <li>If P is equal to the passcode, the judge will print 2 and your program should stop guessing.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ol>

 * Interactivity
 * This is an interactive problem. Your solution will be tested against an interactive judge which reads the output of your solution

 * 
 * The judge starts by printing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^4), which represents the length of the passcode S. The passcode only contains the letters {"P", "I", "Z", "A"}.
 * Next, your solution must output a guess string P which must contain at least 1 letter and at most n letters.
 * After this, the judge will respond as follows:
 * - If P is not a prefix of S, the judge will print 0.
 * - If P is a prefix of S, the judge will print 1.
 * - If P is equal to the passcode, the judge will print 2 and your program should stop guessing.
 * 
 * Make sure to flush after each guess. For example:
 * - In Python: print(..., flush=True)
 * - In C++: cout << ... << endl;
 * - In Java: System.out.flush();
 * 
 * The problem comes with a testing tool to help test your solution.
